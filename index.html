    <p>This is a project for the National Institute for Congestion Reduction. </p>
       <p> We are working on a mobile application that will pair UPRM students together for their journeys to and from the university. This application will grant users access to a designated, controlled-access parking lot with a guaranteed parking space. 
        <p>The project aims to reduce traffic congestion, reduce the strain on limited parking spaces, and provide a convenient parking experience for students in campus.</p>
        <p>Our primary goal is to efficiently manage parking reservations through an optimized pairing system. This system will group students based on proximity and similar arrival and departure times.</p>
